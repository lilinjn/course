                <div class="entry">
                	<p><em>Here&#8217;s just a little aside about the pushforward of a unit vector and its relationship to the usual notion of taking a derivative.  We&#8217;re going to use this idea a <b>lot</b> as the course goes on, so make sure you really &#8220;get it!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Derivatives on the Real Line</u></b></p>
<p>So far we&#8217;ve been thinking about the differential in a very geometric way: it tells us how to stretch out or <em>push forward</em> tangent vectors as we go from one place to another.  In fact, we can apply this geometric viewpoint to pretty much any situation where derivatives are involved.  For instance, think about a good old fashioned real-valued function \(\phi(x)\) on the real line.  Typically we visualize \(\phi\) by plotting its value as a height over the \(x\)-axis:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_phi_graph.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_phi_graph.svg" alt="" title="ddg_phi_graph" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-140" /></a></p>
<p>In this case, the derivative \(\phi^\prime\) can be interpreted as the slope of the height function, as suggested by the dashed line in the picture above.  Alternatively, we can imagine that \(\phi\) stretches out the real line itself, indicated by the change in node spacing in this picture:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_phi_stretch.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_phi_stretch.svg" alt="" title="ddg_phi_stretch" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-141" /></a></p>
<p>Where the derivative is large, nodes are spaced far apart; where the derivative is small, nodes are spaced close together.  This picture inspires us to write the derivative of \(\phi\) in terms of the push-forward \(d\phi(X)\) of a unit tangent vector \(X\) pointing along the positive \(x\)-axis:</p>
<p>\[ \phi^\prime = d\phi(X). \]</p>
<p>In other words, the derivative of \(\phi\) is just the &#8220;stretch factor&#8221; as we go from one copy of \(\mathbb{R}\) to the other.  But wait a minute &#8212; does this equality even make sense?  The thing on the left is a scalar, but the thing on the right is a vector!  Of course, any tangent vector on the real line can be represented as just a single value, quantifying its extent in the positive or negative direction.  So this expression does make sense &#8212; as long as we understand that we&#8217;re identifying tangent vectors on \(\mathbb{R}\) with real numbers.  Often this kind of &#8220;type checking&#8221; can help verify that formulas and expressions are correct, similar to the way you might check for matching units in a physical equation.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another question: how is this interpretation of the derivative any different from our usual interpretation in terms of height functions?  Aren&#8217;t we also stretching out the real line in that case?  Well, yes and no &#8212; certainly the real line still gets stretched out into some other curve.  But this curve is now a subset of the plane \(\mathbb{R}^2\) &#8212; in particular, it&#8217;s the curve \(\gamma = (x,\phi(x))\).  So for one thing, &#8220;type checking&#8221; fails in this case: \(\phi^\prime\) is a scalar, but \(d\gamma(X)\) is a 2-vector.  But most importantly, the <em>amount</em> of stretching experienced by the curve doesn&#8217;t correspond to our usual notion of the derivative of \(\phi\) &#8212; for instance, if we look at the magnitude of \(|d\gamma(X)|\) we get \(\sqrt{1+(\phi^\prime)^2}\).  (Why is this statement true geometrically?  How <em>could</em> you write \(\phi^\prime\) in terms of \(d\gamma(X)\)?  Can you come up with an expression where you recover the proper sign?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Directional Derivatives</u></b></p>
<p>So far so good: we can think of the derivative of a real-valued function on \(\mathbb{R}\) as the pushforward of a (positively-oriented) unit tangent vector \(X\).  But what does \(d\phi(X)\) mean if \(\phi\) is defined over some other domain, like the plane \(\mathbb{R}^2\)?  This question may &#8220;stretch&#8221; your mind a little, but if you can understand this example then you&#8217;re well on your way to understanding derivatives in terms of tangent vectors.  Let&#8217;s take a look at the geometry of the problem &#8212; again, there are two ways we could plot \(\phi\).  The usual approach is to draw a height function over the plane:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_phi_height.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_phi_height.svg" alt="" title="ddg_phi_height" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-142" /></a></p>
<p>The derivative has something to do with the slope of this hill, but in which direction?  To answer this question, we can introduce the idea of a <em>directional derivative</em> &#8212; i.e., we pick a vector \(X\) and see how quickly we travel uphill (or downhill) in that direction.  And again we can consider an alternative picture:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_phi_plane.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_phi_plane.svg" alt="" title="ddg_phi_plane" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-143" /></a></p>
<p>Since \(\phi\) is a map from \(\mathbb{R}^2\) to \(\mathbb{R}\), we can imagine that it takes a flat sheet of rubber and stretches it out into a long, skinny, one-dimensional object along the real line.  Therefore if we draw an arrow \(X\) on the original sheet, then the &#8220;stretched-out&#8221; arrow \(d\phi(X)\) gives us the rate of change in \(\phi\) along the direction \(X\), i.e., the directional derivative.  What about type checking?  As before, everything matches up: \(d\phi(X)\) is a tangent vector on \(\mathbb{R}\), so it can be represented by a single real number.  (What if we had continued to work with the height function above?  How could we recover the directional derivative in this case?)</p>
<p>By the way, don&#8217;t worry if this discussion seems horribly informal!  We&#8217;ll see a more explicit, algebraic treatment of these ideas when we start talking about exterior calculus.  The important thing for now is to build some geometric intuition about derivatives.  In particular: a map from any space to any other space can be viewed as some kind of bending and twisting and stretching (or possibly tearing!); derivatives can be understood in terms of what happens to little arrows along the way.</p>

                <div class="entry">
                	<p>There are many ways to think about the geometry of a surface (using <em>charts</em>, for instance) but here&#8217;s a picture that is well-suited to the way we work with surfaces in the discrete setting.  Imagine that our surface is a topological disk.  Its geometry can be described via a map \(f: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3\) from a region \(M\) in the Euclidean plane \(\mathbb{R}^2\) to a subset \(f(M)\) of \(\mathbb{R}^3\):</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_surface_patch.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_surface_patch.svg" alt="" title="ddg_surface_patch" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106" /></a></p>
<p>The <em>differential</em> of such a map, denoted by \(df\), tells us how to map a vector \(X\) in the plane to the corresponding vector \(df(X)\) on the surface.  Loosely speaking, imagine that \(M\) is a rubber sheet and \(X\) is a little black line segment drawn on \(M\).  As we stretch and deform \(M\) into \(f(M)\), the segment \(X\) also gets stretched and deformed into a different segment, which we call \(df(X)\).  Later on we can talk about how to explicitly express \(df(X)\) in coordinates and so on, but it&#8217;s important to realize that fundamentally there&#8217;s <em>nothing deeper to know about the differential than the picture you see here</em> &#8212; the differential simply tells you how to stretch out or <em>&#8220;push forward&#8221;</em> vectors as you go from one space to another.  For example, the length of a tangent vector \(X\) pushed forward by \(f\) can be expressed as</p>
<p>\[ \sqrt{ df(X) \cdot df(X) }, \]</p>
<p>where \(\cdot\) is the standard inner product (a.k.a. <em>dot product</em> or <em>scalar product</em>) on \(\mathbb{R}^3\).  Note that this length is typically <em>different</em> than the length of the vector we started with!  To keep things clear, we&#8217;ll use angle brackets to denote the inner product in the plane, e.g., the length of the original vector would be \(\sqrt{\langle X, X \rangle}\).  More generally, we can measure the inner product between any <em>two</em> tangent vectors \(df(X)\) and \(df(Y)\):</p>
<p>\[ g(X,Y) = df(X) \cdot df(Y). \]</p>
<p>The map \(g\) is called the <em>metric</em> of the surface, or to be more pedantic, the <em>metric induced by \(f\)</em>.</p>
<p>So far we&#8217;ve been talking about <em>tangent</em> vectors, i.e., vectors that travel &#8220;along&#8221; the surface.  We&#8217;re also interested in vectors that are orthogonal to the surface.  In particular, we say that a vector \(u \in \mathbb{R}^3\) is <em>normal</em> to the surface at a point \(p\) if</p>
<p>\[ df(X) \cdot u = 0 \]</p>
<p>for all tangent vectors \(X\) at \(p\).  For convenience, we often single out a particular normal vector \(\hat{N}\) called the <em>unit normal</em>, which has length one.  Of course, at any given point there are two distinct unit normal vectors: \(+\hat{N}\) and \(-\hat{N}\).  Which one should we use?  If we can pick a consistent direction for \(\hat{N}\) then we say that \(M\) is <em>orientable</em>.  For instance, the torus is orientable, but the M&ouml;bius band is not:</p>
<p><center><br />
<img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_torus.svg"/><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_mobius.svg"/><br />
</center></p>
<p>For orientable surfaces, we can actually think of \(\hat{N}\) as a continuous map \(\hat{N}: M \rightarrow S^2\) (called the <em>Gauss map</em>) which associates each point with its unit normal, viewed as a point on the unit sphere \(S^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3\).  In fact, why not think of \(\hat{N}\) as simply a different geometry for \(M\)?  Now the map \(d\hat{N}\) (called the <em>Weingarten map</em>) tells us about the change in <em>normal direction</em> as we move from one point to the other.  For instance, we could look at the change in normal along a particular tangent direction \(X\) by evaluating</p>
<p>\[ \kappa_n(X) = \frac{df(X) \cdot d\hat{N}(X)}{|df(X)|^2}. \]</p>
<p>(The factor \(|df(X)|^2\) in the denominator simply accounts for any &#8220;stretching out&#8221; of \(X\) that occurs as we go from the plane to the surface.)  The quantity \(\kappa_n\) is called the <em>normal curvature</em> &#8212; we&#8217;ll have a lot more to say about curvature in the future.</p>
<p>Overall we end up with this picture, which captures the most fundamental ideas about the geometry of surfaces:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_surface_geometry.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_surface_geometry.svg" alt="" title="ddg_surface_geometry" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-108" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Conformal Parameterization</u></b></p>
<p>When working with curves, one often introduces the idea of an <em>isometric</em> (a.k.a. <em>arc-length</em> or <em>unit speed</em>) parameterization.  The idea there is to make certain expressions simpler by assuming that no &#8220;stretching&#8221; occurs as we go from the domain into \(\mathbb{R}^3\).  One way to state this requirement is</p>
<p>\[ |df(X)| = |X|, \]</p>
<p>i.e., we ask that the norm of any vector \(X\) is preserved.</p>
<p>For surfaces, an isometric parameterization does not always exist (not even locally!).  Most of the time you simply have to stretch things out.  For instance, you may know that it&#8217;s impossible to flatten the surface of the Earth onto the plane without distortion &#8212; that&#8217;s why we end up with all sorts of different funky projections of the globe.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_globe_projections.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_globe_projections.svg" alt="" title="ddg_globe_projections" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-109" /></a></p>
<p>However, there is a setup that (like arc-length parameterization for curves) makes life a lot easier when dealing with certain expressions, namely <em>conformal parameterization</em>.  Put quite simply, a map \(f\) is conformal if it preserves the <em>angle</em> between any two vectors.  More specifically, a conformal map \(f: \mathbb{R}^2 \supset M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3\) satisfies</p>
<p>\[ df(X) \cdot df(Y) = a \langle X, Y \rangle \]</p>
<p>for all tangent vectors \(X, Y\), where \(a\) is a <b>positive</b> function and \(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle\) is the usual inner product on \(\mathbb{R}^2\).  In practice, the function \(a\) is often replaced with \(e^u\) for some real-valued function \(u\) &#8212; this way, one never has to worry about whether the scaling is positive.  Notice that vectors can still get <em>stretched out</em>, but the surface never gets <em>sheared</em> &#8212; for instance, orthogonal vectors always stay orthogonal:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_conformal_map.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_conformal_map.svg" alt="" title="ddg_conformal_map" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-110" /></a></p>
<p>A key fact about conformal maps is that they always exist, as guaranteed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformization_theorem">uniformization theorem</a>.  In a nutshell, the uniformization theorem says that any disk can be conformally mapped to the plane.  So if we consider any point \(p\) on our surface \(f(M)\), we know that we can always find a conformal parameterization in some small, disk-like neighborhood around \(p\).  As with unit-speed curves, it is often enough to simply know that a conformal parameterization <em>exists</em> &#8212; we do not have to construct the map explicitly.  And, as with arc-length parameterization, we have to keep track of the least possible amount of information about how the domain gets stretched out: just a single number at each point (as opposed to, say, an entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant">Jacobian matrix</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From time to time in this class we may adopt the convention that \(f\) is conformal in order to simplify our derivations, so <em>pay attention!</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Euler Characteristic</u></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Exercise 1.1: Polyhedral Formula</b> A topological <em>disk</em> is, roughly speaking, any shape you can get by deforming the region bounded by a circle without tearing it, puncturing it, or gluing its edges together.  Some examples of shapes that are disks include a flag, a leaf, and a glove.  Some examples of shapes that are <em>not</em> disks include a circle (why?), a ball, a sphere, a DVD, a donut, and a teapot.  A <em>polygonal disk</em> is any disk constructed out of simple polygons.  Similarly, a topological <em>sphere</em> is any shape resembling the standard sphere, and a <em>polyhedron</em> is a sphere made of polygons.  More generally, a <em>piecewise linear</em> surface is any surface made by gluing together polygons along their edges; a <em>simplicial surface</em> is a special case of a piecewise linear surface where all the faces are triangles.  The <em>boundary</em> of a piecewise linear surface is the set of edges that are contained in only a single face (all other edges are shared by exactly two faces).  For example, a disk has a boundary whereas a polyhedron does not.  You may assume that surfaces have no boundary unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/disk_example.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/disk_example.svg" alt="" title="disk_example" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70" /></a></p>
<p>Show that for any polygonal disk with $V$ vertices, $E$ edges, and $F$ faces, the following relationship holds:</p>
<p>\[ V - E + F = 1 \]</p>
<p>and conclude that for any polyhedron $V &#8211; E + F = 2$.</p>
<p><em>Hint: use induction.  Note that induction is generally easier if you start with a given object and decompose it into <b>smaller</b> pieces rather than trying to make it <b>larger</b>, because there are fewer cases to think about.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Euler-Poincar&eacute; Formula</b></p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/polygonal_genus.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/polygonal_genus.svg" alt="" title="polygonal_genus" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76" /></a></p>
<p>Clearly not all surfaces look like disks or spheres.  Some surfaces have additional <em>handles</em> that distinguish them topologically; the number of handles $g$ is known as the <em>genus</em> of the surface (see illustration above for examples).  In fact, among all surfaces that have no boundary and are connected (meaning a single piece), compact (meaning closed and contained in a ball of finite size), and orientable (having two distinct sides), the genus is the <em>only</em> thing that distinguishes two surfaces.  A more general formula applies to such surfaces, namely</p>
<p>\[ V - E + F = 2 - 2g, \]</p>
<p>which is known as the <em>Euler-Poincar&eacute; formula.</em>  (You do not have to prove anything about this statement, but it will be useful in later calculations.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Tessellation</u></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Exercise 1.2: Regular Valence</b></p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/regular_valence.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/regular_valence.svg" alt="" title="regular_valence" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71" /></a></p>
<p>The <em>valence</em> of a vertex in a piecewise linear surface is the number of faces that contain that vertex.  A vertex of a <em>simplicial</em> surface is said to be <em>regular</em> when its valence equals six.  Show that the only (connected, orientable) simplicial surface for which every vertex has regular valence is a torus ($g=1$).  You may assume that the surface has finitely many faces.</p>
<p><em>Hint: apply the Euler-Poincar&eacute; formula.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Exercise 1.3: Minimally Irregular Valence</b> Show that the minimum possible number of irregular valence vertices in a (connected, orientable) simplicial surface $K$ of genus $g$ is given by</p>
<p>\[<br />
    m(K) = \begin{cases}<br />
              4, &#038; g = 0 \\<br />
              0, &#038; g = 1 \\<br />
              1, &#038; g \geq 2,<br />
           \end{cases}<br />
\]</p>
<p>assuming that all vertices have valence at least three and that there are finitely many faces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Exercise 1.4: Mean Valence</b> Show that the mean valence approaches six as the number of vertices in a (connected, orientable) simplicial surface goes to infinity, and that the ratio of vertices to edges to faces hence approaches</p>
<p>\[ V:E:F = 1:3:2. \]</p>

<p><b><u>Discrete Gaussian Curvature</u></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Exercise 1.5: Area of a Spherical Triangle</b> Show that the area of a spherical triangle on the unit sphere with interior angles $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, $\alpha_3$ is</p>
<p>\[ A = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 - \pi. \]</p>
<p><em>Hint: consider the areas $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$ of the three shaded regions (called &#8220;diangles&#8221;) pictured below.</em></p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/spherical_triangle.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/spherical_triangle.svg" alt="" title="spherical_triangle" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-72" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Exercise 1.6: Area of a Spherical Polygon</b> Show that the area of a spherical polygon with consecutive interior angles $\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n$ is</p>
<p>\[ A = (2-n) \pi + \sum_{i=1}^n \beta_i. \]</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/spherical_polygon.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/spherical_polygon.svg" alt="" title="spherical_polygon" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73" /></a></p>
<p><em>Hint: use the expression for the area of a spherical triangle you just derived!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Exercise 1.7: Angle Defect</b> Recall that for a discrete planar curve we can define the curvature at a vertex as the distance on the unit circle between the two adjacent normals.  For a discrete <em>surface</em> we can define (Gaussian) curvature at a vertex $v$ as the <em>area</em> on the unit sphere bounded by a spherical polygon whose vertices are the unit normals of the faces around $v$.  Show that this area is equal to the <em>angle defect</em></p>
<p>\[ d(v) = 2\pi - \sum_{ f \in F_v } \angle_f(v) \]</p>
<p>where $F_v$ is the set of faces containing $v$ and $\angle_f(v)$ is the interior angle of the face $f$ at vertex $v$.</p>
<p><em>Hint: consider planes that contain two consecutive normals and their intersection with the unit sphere.</em></p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/angle_defect.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/angle_defect.svg" alt="" title="angle_defect" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Exercise 1.8: Discrete Gauss-Bonnet Theorem</b> Consider a (connected, orientable) simplicial surface $K$ with finitely many vertices $V$, edges $E$ and faces $F$.  Show that a discrete analog of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem holds for simplicial surfaces, namely</p>
<p>\[ \sum_{ v \in V } d(v) = 2 \pi \chi \]</p>
<p>where $\chi = |V| &#8211; |E| + |F|$ is the <em>Euler characteristic</em> of the surface.</p>
