                <div class="entry">
                    <p>Let&#8217;s take a more in-depth look at the curvature of surfaces.  The word &#8220;curvature&#8221; really corresponds to our everyday understanding of what it means for something to be curved: eggshells, donuts, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavatappi">cavatappi pasta</a> have a lot of curvature;  floors, ceilings, and cardboard boxes do not.  But what about something like a beer bottle?  Along one direction the bottle quickly curves around in a circle; along another direction it&#8217;s completely flat and travels along a straight line:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_beer_bottle.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_beer_bottle.svg" alt="" title="ddg_beer_bottle" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-215" /></a></p>
<p>This way of looking at curvature &#8212; in terms of curves traveling along the surface &#8212; is often how we treat curvature in general.  In particular, let \(X\) be a unit tangent direction at some distinguished point on the surface, and consider a plane containing both \(df(X)\) and the corresponding normal \(N\).  This plane intersects the surface in a curve, and the curvature \(\kappa_n\) of this curve is called the <em>normal curvature</em> in the direction \(X\):</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_normal_curvature.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_normal_curvature.svg" alt="" title="ddg_normal_curvature" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216" /></a></p>
<p>Remember the <a href="index.html@p=187.html">Frenet-Serret formulas</a>?  They tell us that the change in the normal along a <em>curve</em> is given by \(dN = -\kappa T + \tau B\).  We can therefore get the normal curvature along \(X\) by extracting the tangential part of \(dN\):</p>
<p>\[ \kappa_n(X) = \frac{-df(X) \cdot dN(X)}{|df(X)|^2}. \]</p>
<p>The factor \(|df(X)|^2\) in the denominator simply normalizes any &#8220;stretching out&#8221; that occurs as we go from the domain \(M\) into \(\mathbb{R}^3\) &#8212; a derivation of this formula can be found in Appendix A.  Note that normal curvature is <em>signed</em>, meaning the surface can bend toward the normal or away from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Principal, Mean, and Gaussian Curvature</u></b></p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_principal_curvature.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_principal_curvature.svg" alt="" title="ddg_principal_curvature" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-217" /></a></p>
<p>At any given point we can ask: along which directions does the surface bend the most?  The unit vectors \(X_1\) and \(X_2\) along which we find the maximum and minimum normal curvatures \(\kappa_1\) and \(\kappa_2\) are called the <em>principal directions</em>; the curvatures \(\kappa_i\) are called the <em>principal curvatures</em>.  For instance, the beer bottle above might have principal curvatures \(\kappa_1 = 1\), \(\kappa_2 = 0\) at the marked point.</p>
<p>We can also talk about principal curvature in terms of the <em>shape operator</em>, which is the unique map \(S: TM \rightarrow TM\) satisfying</p>
<p>\[ df(SX) = dN(X) \]</p>
<p>for all tangent vectors \(X\).  The shape operator \(S\) and the Weingarten map \(dN\) essentially represent the same idea: they both tell us how the normal changes as we travel along a direction \(X\).  The only difference is that \(S\) specifies this change in terms of a tangent vector on \(M\), whereas \(dN\) gives us the change as a tangent vector in \(\mathbb{R}^3\).  It&#8217;s worth noting that many authors do not make this distinction, and simply assume an isometric identification of tangent vectors on \(M\) and the corresponding tangent vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^3\).  However, we choose to be more careful so that we can explicitly account for the dependence of various quantities on the immersion \(f\) &#8212; this dependence becomes particularly important if you actually want to compute something!  (By the way, why can we always express the change in \(N\) in terms of a <em>tangent</em> vector? It&#8217;s because \(N\) is the <em>unit</em> normal, hence it cannot grow or shrink in the normal direction.)</p>
<p>One important fact about the principal directions and principal curvatures is that they correspond to eigenvectors and eigenvalues (respectively) of the shape operator:</p>
<p>\[ S X_i = \kappa_i X_i. \]</p>
<p>Moreover, the principal directions are orthogonal with respect to the induced metric: \(g(X_1,X_2) = df(X_1) \cdot df(X_2) = 0\) &#8212; see Appendix B for a proof of these two facts.  The principal curvatures therefore tell us everything there is to know about normal curvature at a point, since we can express any tangent vector \(Y\) as a linear combination of the principal directions \(X_1\) and \(X_2\).  In particular, if \(Y\) is a unit vector offset from \(X_1\) by an angle \(\theta\), then the associated normal curvature is</p>
<p>\[ \kappa_n(Y) = \kappa_1 \cos^2 \theta + \kappa_2 \sin^2 \theta, \]</p>
<p>as you should be able to easily verify using the relationships above.  Often, however, working directly with principal curvatures is fairly inconvenient &#8212; especially in the discrete setting.</p>
<p>On the other hand, two closely related quantities &#8212; called the <em>mean curvature</em> and the <em>Gaussian curvature</em> will show up over and over again (and have some particularly nice interpretations in the discrete world).  The mean curvature \(H\) is the arithmetic mean of principal curvatures:</p>
<p>\[ H = \frac{\kappa_1 + \kappa_2}{2}, \]</p>
<p>and the Gaussian curvature is the (square of the) geometric mean:</p>
<p>\[ K = \kappa_1 \kappa_2. \]</p>
<p>What do the values of \(H\) and \(K\) imply about the shape of the surface?  Perhaps the most elementary interpretation is that Gaussian curvature is like a logical &#8220;and&#8221; (is there curvature along <em>both</em> directions?) whereas mean curvature is more like a logical &#8220;or&#8221; (is there curvature along <em>at least one</em> direction?)  Of course, you have to be a little careful here since you can also get zero mean curvature when \(\kappa_1 = -\kappa_2\).</p>
<p>It also helps to see pictures of surfaces with zero mean and Gaussian curvature.  Zero-curvature surfaces are so well-studied in mathematics that they have special names.  Surfaces with zero Gaussian curvature are called <em>developable surfaces</em> because they can be &#8220;developed&#8221; or flattened out into the plane without any stretching or tearing.  For instance, any piece of a cylinder is developable since one of the principal curvatures is zero:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_cylinder.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_cylinder.svg" alt="" title="ddg_cylinder" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-218" /></a></p>
<p>Surfaces with zero mean curvature are called <em>minimal surfaces</em> because (as we&#8217;ll see later) they minimize surface area (with respect to certain constraints).  Minimal surfaces tend to be saddle-like since principal curvatures have equal magnitude but opposite sign:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_saddle.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_saddle.svg" alt="" title="ddg_saddle" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-219" /></a></p>
<p>The saddle is also a good example of a surface with negative <em>Gaussian</em> curvature.  What does a surface with positive Gaussian curvature look like?  The hemisphere is one example:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_dome.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_dome.svg" alt="" title="ddg_dome" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-220" /></a></p>
<p>Note that in this case \(\kappa_1 = \kappa_2\) and so principal directions are not uniquely defined &#8212; maximum (and minimum) curvature is achieved along <em>any</em> direction \(X\).  Any such point on a surface is called an <em>umbilic point</em>.</p>
<p>There are plenty of cute theorems and relationships involving curvature, but those are the basic facts: the curvature of a surface is completely characterized by the <em>principal curvatures</em>, which are the maximum and minimum <em>normal curvatures</em>.  The Gaussian and mean curvature are simply averages of the two principal curvatures, but (as we&#8217;ll see) are often easier to get your hands on in practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>The Second Fundamental Form</u></b></p>
<p>For historical reasons, it&#8217;s probably good to mention an object called the <em>second fundamental form</em>.  I&#8217;m actually not sure what&#8217;s so fundamental about this form, since it&#8217;s nothing more than a mashup of the metric \(g\) and the shape operator \(S\), which themselves are simple functions of two <em>truly</em> fundamental objects, namely the immersion \(f\) and the Gauss map \(N\):</p>
<p>\[ I\!I(X,Y) = -g(SX,Y) = -dN(X) \cdot df(Y). \]</p>
<p>(I suppose &#8220;the somewhat auxilliary form&#8221; didn&#8217;t have a nice ring to it&#8230;)  The most important thing to realize is that \(I\!I\) does not introduce any new <em>geometric</em> ideas &#8212; just another way of writing down things we&#8217;ve already seen.</p>
<p><a name="appendixA"></a><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Appendix A: A Nice Formula for Normal Curvature</u></b></p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_normal_curvature_derivation.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_normal_curvature_derivation.svg" alt="" title="ddg_normal_curvature_derivation" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-221" /></a></p>
<p>Consider a unit-speed curve \(c(t)\) on a domain \(M \subset \mathbb{R}^2\), and an immersion \(f\) of \(M\) into \(\mathbb{R}^3\); the composition \(\gamma = f(c)\) defines a curve in \(\mathbb{R}^3\).  Letting \(X = \dot{c}\) denote the time derivative of \(c\), we can express the unit tangent field on \(\gamma\) as</p>
<p>\[ T = \frac{df(X)}{|df(X)|}. \]</p>
<p>Recall from our <a href="index.html@p=187.html">notes on curves</a> that the curvature normal \(\kappa n\) is defined as the change in tangent direction as we travel along the curve at unit speed (we&#8217;ll use a lowercase &#8220;\(n\)&#8221; here to distinguish from the surface normal \(N\)).  In this case, however, the initially unit-speed curve \(c\) may get stretched out by the map \(f\).  Therefore, to get the curvature normal we have to evaluate</p>
<p>\[ \kappa n = \frac{dT}{d\ell}, \]</p>
<p>where \(\ell\) denotes the distance traveled in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) along \(\gamma\).  The <em>normal curvature</em> \(\kappa_n(\gamma)\) can be defined as the projection of the curvature normal onto the surface normal \(N\).  More explicitly, we have</p>
<p>\[ \kappa_n = N \cdot \kappa n = N \cdot \frac{dT}{d\ell} = N \cdot \frac{dT}{dt}\frac{dt}{d\ell}. \]</p>
<p>The quantity \(\tfrac{d\ell}{dt}\) is just the amount by which the curve gets stretched out as we go from \(M\) into \(\mathbb{R}^3\), which we can also write as \(|df(X)|\).  We therefore have</p>
<p>\[<br />
   \begin{array}{rcl}<br />
      |df(X)| \kappa_N &#038;=&#038; N \cdot \frac{dT}{dt} \\<br />
                               &#038;=&#038; N \cdot \frac{d}{dt}\left( df(X) |df(X)|^{-1} \right) \\<br />
                               &#038;=&#038; N \cdot \left( \frac{d}{dt} df(X) \right) |df(X)|^{-1} + \underbrace{N \cdot df(X)}_{=0} \left( \frac{d}{dt} |df(X)|^{-1} \right) \\<br />
                               &#038;=&#038; N \cdot \left( \frac{d}{dt} df(\dot{c}) \right) |df(\dot{c})|^{-1} \\<br />
                               &#038;=&#038; \displaystyle\frac{N \cdot df(\ddot{c})}{|df(\dot{c})|}.<br />
   \end{array}<br />
\]</p>
<p>Noting that \(N \cdot df(\dot{c}) = 0\) implies \(N \cdot df(\ddot{c}) = -\dot{N} \cdot df(\dot{c})\), and moreover that \(\dot{N} = dN(\dot{c})\), we get</p>
<p>\[ |df(X)| \kappa_N = \frac{-dN(\dot{c}) \cdot df(\dot{c})}{|df(\dot{c})|}, \]</p>
<p>or equivalently</p>
<p>\[ \kappa_N = \frac{-dN(X) \cdot df(X)}{|df(X)|^2}, \]</p>
<p>which is the formula introduced above.</p>
<p><a name="appendixB"></a><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Appendix B: Why Are Principal Directions Orthogonal?</u></b></p>
<p>Earlier we stated that the unit principal directions \(X_1, X_2\) are orthogonal with respect to the metric \(g\) induced by the immersion \(f\), i.e.,</p>
<p>\[ g(X_1,X_2) = df(X_1) \cdot df(X_2) = 0. \]</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s show that</p>
<p>\[ g(SX,Y) = g(X,SY), \]</p>
<p>i.e., \(S\) is <em>self-adjoint</em> with respect to the induced metric (equivalently: the second fundamental form \(I\!I\) is symmetric in its two arguments, i.e., \(I\!I(X,Y)=I\!I(Y,X)\)).  To see why, consider that (by definition) the normal \(N\) is orthogonal to any tangent vector \(df(X)\):</p>
<p>\[ N \cdot df(X) = 0. \]</p>
<p>Differentiating this expression with respect to some other direction \(Y\), we get</p>
<p>\[ dN(Y) \cdot df(X) = -N \cdot d(df(X))(Y). \]</p>
<p>Using the equality of mixed partial derivatives, we see that \(S\) is indeed self-adjoint with respect to \(g\):</p>
<p>\[<br />
   \begin{array}{rcl}<br />
      g(SX,Y) &#038;=&#038; dN(X) \cdot df(Y) \\<br />
              &#038;=&#038; -N \cdot d(df(X))(Y) \\<br />
              &#038;=&#038; -N \cdot d(df(Y))(X) \\<br />
              &#038;=&#038; dN(Y) \cdot df(X) \\<br />
              &#038;=&#038; g(X,SY).<br />
   \end{array}<br />
\]</p>
<p>(By the way, the essential trick we used here comes up all the time: if you see a product involving a derivative, try expressing it in terms of the derivative of a product.)  Returning to our original question, we have</p>
<p>\[<br />
   \begin{array}{rcl}<br />
      \kappa_1 g(X_1,X_2) &#038;=&#038; \kappa_1 df(X_1) \cdot df(X_2) \\<br />
                          &#038;=&#038; dN(X_1) \cdot df(X_2) \\<br />
                          &#038;=&#038; dN(X_2) \cdot df(X_1) \\<br />
                          &#038;=&#038; \kappa_2 df(X_2) \cdot df(X_1) \\<br />
                          &#038;=&#038; \kappa_2 g(X_1,X_2).<br />
   \end{array}<br />
\]</p>
<p>Therefore, either \(\kappa_1 = \kappa_2\) or else \(g(X_1,X_2)=0\).  But if \(\kappa_1 = \kappa_2\) (i.e., the maximum and minimum principle curvatures are equal) then we&#8217;re at an <em>umbilic point</em> where all normal curvatures are equal &#8212; in this case we&#8217;re free to pick the principal directions however we please &#8212; in particular, we can use an arbitrary pair of orthogonal directions.  The phenomenon we experience here reflects a more general phenomenon in linear algebra: roughly speaking, if \(A\) is self-adjoint with respect to \(B\), then \(A\)&#8217;s eigenvectors will be orthogonal with respect to \(B\).</p>
<p>One final question: why should \(\kappa_1\) and \(\kappa_2\) be the <em>maximum</em> and <em>minimum</em> normal curvatures?  Well, think about what the largest and smallest eigenvalues of a linear map represent: they represent the largest and smallest amount of &#8220;stretch&#8221; experienced by a unit vector in any direction.  Hence, the normal curvature can be no larger than \(\kappa_1\) and no smaller than \(\kappa_2\).</p>
