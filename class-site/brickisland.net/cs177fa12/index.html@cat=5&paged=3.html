                	<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_curve.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_curve.svg" alt="" title="ddg_curve" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-188" /></a></p>
<p>The picture we looked at for surfaces is actually a nice way of thinking about manifolds of any dimension.  For instance, we can think of a one-dimensional curve as a map \(\gamma: I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3\) from an interval \(I = [0,T] \subset \mathbb{R}\) of the real line to \(\mathbb{R}^3\).  Again the differential \(d\gamma\) tells us how tangent vectors get stretched out by \(\gamma\), and again the induced length of a tangent vector \(X\) is given by</p>
<p>\[ |d\gamma(X)| = \sqrt{d\gamma(X) \cdot d\gamma(X)}. \]</p>
<p>Working with curves is often easier if \(\gamma\) preserves <em>length</em>, i.e., if for every tangent vector \(X\) we have</p>
<p>\[ |d\gamma(X)| = |X|. \]</p>
<p>There are various names for such a parameterization (<em>&#8220;unit speed&#8221;</em>, <em>&#8220;arc-length&#8221;</em>, <em>&#8220;isometric&#8221;</em>) but the idea is simply that the curve doesn&#8217;t get stretched out when we go from \(\mathbb{R}\) to \(\mathbb{R}^3\) &#8212; think of \(\gamma\) as a completely relaxed rubber band.  This unit-speed view is also often the right one for the discrete setting where we have no notion of a base domain \(I\) &#8212; from the very beginning, the curve is given to us as a subset of \(\mathbb{R}^3\) and all we can do is assume that it sits there in a relaxed state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>The Frenet Frame</u></b></p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_frenet.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_frenet.svg" alt="" title="ddg_frenet" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-189" /></a></p>
<p>Suppose we have a unit-speed curve \(\gamma\) and a positively-oriented unit vector \(X\) on the interval \(I\).  Then<br />
\[ T = d\gamma(X) \]<br />
is a unit vector in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) tangent to the curve.  Carrying this idea one step further, we can look at the change in tangent direction as we move along \(\gamma\).  Since \(T\) may change at any rate (or not at all!) we split up the change into two pieces: a unit vector \(N\) called the <em>principal normal</em> that expresses the direction of change, and a scalar \(\kappa \in \mathbb{R}\) called the <em>curvature</em> that expresses the magnitude of change:</p>
<p>\[ dT(X) = \kappa N. \]</p>
<p>One thing to realize is that \(T\) and \(N\) are always orthogonal.  Why?  Because if the change in \(T\) were <em>parallel</em> to \(T\), then it would cease to have unit length!  (This argument is a good one to keep in mind any time you work with unit vector fields.)  Together with a third vector \(B = T \times N\) called the <em>binormal</em>, we end up with a very natural orthonormal coordinate frame called the <em>Frenet frame</em>.</p>
<p>How does this frame change as we move along the curve?  The answer is given by the <em>Frenet-Serret formula</em>:<br />
\[ \underbrace{\left[ \begin{array}{c} \dot{T} \\ \dot{B} \\ \dot{N} \end{array} \right]}_{\dot{Q} \in \mathbb{R}^3} = \underbrace{\left[ \begin{array}{rrr} 0 &#038; \kappa &#038; 0 \\ -\kappa &#038; 0 &#038; \tau \\ 0 &#038; -\tau &#038; 0 \end{array} \right]}_{A \in \mathbb{R}^3} \underbrace{\left[ \begin{array}{c} T \\ N \\ B \end{array} \right]}_{Q \in \mathbb{R}^3}. \]<br />
Here \(T\), \(N\), and \(B\) are interpreted as row vectors, and the superscript &#8220;\(\ \dot{}\ \)&#8221; is shorthand for &#8220;change in time,&#8221; i.e., the change in a quantity as we move along the curve.  For instance, \(\dot{T} = dT(X)\), where \(X\) is a positively-oriented unit vector on \(I\).  The quantity \(\tau\) is called the <em>torsion</em>, and describes the way the normal and binormal twist around the curve.</p>
<p>A concise proof of this formula was given by Cartan.  First, since the vectors \(T\), \(N\), and \(B\) are mutually orthogonal, one can easily verify that \(Q Q^T = I\), i.e., \(Q\) is an orthogonal matrix.  Differentiating this relationship in time, we find that \(\dot{Q} Q^T = -(\dot{Q} Q^T)^T\), i.e., the matrix \(\dot{Q} Q^T\) is <em>skew-symmetric</em>.  But since \(A = \dot{Q} Q^T\), \(A\) must also be skew-symmetric.  Skew symmetry implies that the diagonal of \(A\) is zero (why?) and moreover, we already know what the top row (and hence the left column) looks like from our definition of \(\kappa\) and \(N\).  The remaining value \(A_{23} = -A_{32}\) is not constrained in any way, so we simply give it a name \(\tau \in \mathbb{R}\).</p>
<p>What do you think about this proof?  On the one hand it&#8217;s easy to verify; on the other hand, it provides little geometric understanding.  For instance, why does \(N\) change in the direction of both \(T\) and \(B\), but \(B\) changes only in the direction of \(N\)?  Can you come up with more geometric arguments?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Visualizing Curvature</u></b></p>
<p>What&#8217;s the curvature of a circle \(S\)?  Well, if \(S\) has radius \(r\) then it takes time \(2\pi r\) to go all the way around the circle at unit speed. During this time the tangent turns around by an angle \(2\pi\).  Of course, since \(T\) has unit length the instantaneous change in \(T\) is described exclusively by the instantaneous change in angle.  So we end up with</p>
<p>\[\kappa = |\kappa N| = |dT(X)| = 2\pi/2\pi r = 1/r.\]</p>
<p>In other words, the curvature of a circle is simply the reciprocal of its radius.  This fact should make some intuitive sense: if we watch a circle grow bigger and bigger, it eventually looks just like a straight line with zero curvature: \(\lim_{r \rightarrow \infty} 1/r = 0\). Similarly, if we watch a circle grow smaller and smaller it eventually looks like a single point with infinite curvature: \(\lim_{r \rightarrow 0} 1/r = \infty\).</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_osculating_circle.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_osculating_circle.svg" alt="" title="ddg_osculating_circle" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-190" /></a></p>
<p>Now consider a smooth curve \(\gamma\) in the plane.  At any point \(p \in \gamma\) there is a circle \(S\) called the <em>osculating circle</em> that best approximates \(\gamma\), meaning that it has the same tangent direction \(T\) and curvature vector \(\kappa N\).  In other words, the circle and the curve agree &#8220;up to second order.&#8221; (The phrase &#8220;agree up to \(n\)th order&#8221; is just shorthand for saying that the first \(n\) derivatives are equal.)  How do we know such a circle exists?  Easy: we can always construct a circle with the appropriate curvature by setting \(r = 1/\kappa\).  And of course, any circle has some tangent pointing in the direction \(T\).  Alternatively, we can consider the a circle passing through \(p\) and two other points: one approaching from the left, another approaching from the right.  Since these three points are shared by both \(\gamma\) and \(S\), the first and second derivatives will agree in the limit (consider that these points can be used to obtain consistent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference">finite difference approximations</a> of \(T\) and \(\kappa N\)).</p>
<p>The radius and center of the osculating circle are often referred to as the <em>radius of curvature</em> and <em>center of curvature</em>, respectively.  We can tell this same story for any curve in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) by considering the <em>osculating plane</em> \(T \times N\), since this plane contains both the tangent and the curvature vector.</p>
<p>For curves it makes little difference whether we express curvature in terms of a change in the tangent vector or a change in the (principal) normal, since the two vectors are the same up to a quarter-rotation in the osculating plane.  For surfaces, however, it will often make more sense to think of curvature as the change in the normal vector, since we typically don&#8217;t have a distinguished tangent vector to work with.</p>

                <div class="entry">
                	<p>Last week we received a couple questions on homework problem 1.3 regarding whether a constructive proof is necessary, i.e., did you need to actually come up with examples of triangulations that achieve the desired bounds? To reiterate what was said in the comments, the answer is <strong><em>no</em></strong>: <em>you simply needed to show (algebraically) that these bounds hold.</em>  But if you <em>were</em> looking for a constructive proof, a nice tool to know about is something called the <em>fundamental polygon</em>. The basic idea is that a surface of any genus can be cut into a single disk, which can be visualized as a polygon in the plane. Visualizing a triangulation (or other data) on the fundamental polygon is often much simpler than visualizing it on the embedded torus &#8212; consider this example, for instance:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_six_triangle_torus.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_six_triangle_torus.svg" alt="" title="ddg_six_triangle_torus" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-163" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here the arrows mark identifications of edges &#8212; for instance, the top and bottom edges get &#8220;glued&#8221; together along the positive \(x\)-axis. (Try convincing yourself that these gluings really do produce a torus &#8212; note that at some point you&#8217;ll need to make a \(180^\circ\) &#8220;twist.&#8221;) One way to visualize the identifications is to imagine that the fundamental polygon tiles the plane:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_six_triangle_torus_tiling3.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_six_triangle_torus_tiling3.svg" alt="" title="ddg_six_triangle_torus_tiling3" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164" /></a></p>
<p>The torus is interesting because it actually admits two <em>different</em> fundamental polygons: the hexagon and the square (corresponding to two different tilings of the Euclidean plane). So we could also visualize the torus on the square, leading to an even simpler triangulation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_two_triangle_torus.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_two_triangle_torus.svg" alt="" title="ddg_two_triangle_torus" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-165" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(By the way, is this really what you&#8217;d call a triangulation? Each region certainly has three sides, but each &#8220;triangle&#8221; has only one vertex! What about the first example? There all triangles have three vertices, but they share the <em>same</em> three vertices. So combinatorially these triangles are not distinct &#8212; in other words, this tessellation cannot be described via a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex">simplicial complex</a>. What&#8217;s the smallest simplicial decomposition you can come up with for the torus?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general the fundamental polygon for a torus of genus \(g\) has \(4g\) sides with identifications \(a_1 b_1 a_1^{-1} b_1^{-1} \cdots a_n b_n a^{-1}_n b_n\), where two edges with the same letter get identified and inverse just means that the edge direction is reversed. For instance, the fundamental polygon for the double torus looks like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_doubletorus_fundamental_polygon.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_doubletorus_fundamental_polygon.svg" alt="" title="ddg_doubletorus_fundamental_polygon" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-166" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Note that all the polygon vertices ultimately get identified with a single point on the surface.) From here it becomes easy to start playing around with tessellations &#8212; for instance, here&#8217;s how you decompose a surface of any genus into <em>quadrilaterals</em>, using only two irregular vertices (can you do better?):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="../cs177/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ddg_fundamental_polygon_quadrangulated.svg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-103" title="ddg_fundamental_polygon_quadrangulated" src="../cs177/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ddg_fundamental_polygon_quadrangulated.svg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tiling the Euclidean plane with the fundamental polygon is impossible for a surface of genus \(g \geq 2\), since the interior angles of the fundamental polygon don&#8217;t evenly divide \(2\pi\) (proof!). Fortunately, we can still tile the <em>hyperbolic plane</em>, i.e., the plane with constant negative curvature. For instance, here&#8217;s a tiling of the hyperbolic plane by octagons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="../cs177/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ddg_hyperbolic_octagons.svg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-102" title="ddg_hyperbolic_octagons" src="../cs177/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ddg_hyperbolic_octagons.svg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From here there are all sorts of fascinating things to say about covering spaces, uniformization, and especially the <em>fundamental group</em> of a surface &#8212; if you&#8217;re interested I highly recommend you take a look at <a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html">Allen Hatcher&#8217;s (free!) book on algebraic topology</a>.</p>

                	<p><em>Here&#8217;s just a little aside about the pushforward of a unit vector and its relationship to the usual notion of taking a derivative.  We&#8217;re going to use this idea a <b>lot</b> as the course goes on, so make sure you really &#8220;get it!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Derivatives on the Real Line</u></b></p>
<p>So far we&#8217;ve been thinking about the differential in a very geometric way: it tells us how to stretch out or <em>push forward</em> tangent vectors as we go from one place to another.  In fact, we can apply this geometric viewpoint to pretty much any situation where derivatives are involved.  For instance, think about a good old fashioned real-valued function \(\phi(x)\) on the real line.  Typically we visualize \(\phi\) by plotting its value as a height over the \(x\)-axis:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_phi_graph.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_phi_graph.svg" alt="" title="ddg_phi_graph" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-140" /></a></p>
<p>In this case, the derivative \(\phi^\prime\) can be interpreted as the slope of the height function, as suggested by the dashed line in the picture above.  Alternatively, we can imagine that \(\phi\) stretches out the real line itself, indicated by the change in node spacing in this picture:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_phi_stretch.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_phi_stretch.svg" alt="" title="ddg_phi_stretch" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-141" /></a></p>
<p>Where the derivative is large, nodes are spaced far apart; where the derivative is small, nodes are spaced close together.  This picture inspires us to write the derivative of \(\phi\) in terms of the push-forward \(d\phi(X)\) of a unit tangent vector \(X\) pointing along the positive \(x\)-axis:</p>
<p>\[ \phi^\prime = d\phi(X). \]</p>
<p>In other words, the derivative of \(\phi\) is just the &#8220;stretch factor&#8221; as we go from one copy of \(\mathbb{R}\) to the other.  But wait a minute &#8212; does this equality even make sense?  The thing on the left is a scalar, but the thing on the right is a vector!  Of course, any tangent vector on the real line can be represented as just a single value, quantifying its extent in the positive or negative direction.  So this expression does make sense &#8212; as long as we understand that we&#8217;re identifying tangent vectors on \(\mathbb{R}\) with real numbers.  Often this kind of &#8220;type checking&#8221; can help verify that formulas and expressions are correct, similar to the way you might check for matching units in a physical equation.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another question: how is this interpretation of the derivative any different from our usual interpretation in terms of height functions?  Aren&#8217;t we also stretching out the real line in that case?  Well, yes and no &#8212; certainly the real line still gets stretched out into some other curve.  But this curve is now a subset of the plane \(\mathbb{R}^2\) &#8212; in particular, it&#8217;s the curve \(\gamma = (x,\phi(x))\).  So for one thing, &#8220;type checking&#8221; fails in this case: \(\phi^\prime\) is a scalar, but \(d\gamma(X)\) is a 2-vector.  But most importantly, the <em>amount</em> of stretching experienced by the curve doesn&#8217;t correspond to our usual notion of the derivative of \(\phi\) &#8212; for instance, if we look at the magnitude of \(|d\gamma(X)|\) we get \(\sqrt{1+(\phi^\prime)^2}\).  (Why is this statement true geometrically?  How <em>could</em> you write \(\phi^\prime\) in terms of \(d\gamma(X)\)?  Can you come up with an expression where you recover the proper sign?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Directional Derivatives</u></b></p>
<p>So far so good: we can think of the derivative of a real-valued function on \(\mathbb{R}\) as the pushforward of a (positively-oriented) unit tangent vector \(X\).  But what does \(d\phi(X)\) mean if \(\phi\) is defined over some other domain, like the plane \(\mathbb{R}^2\)?  This question may &#8220;stretch&#8221; your mind a little, but if you can understand this example then you&#8217;re well on your way to understanding derivatives in terms of tangent vectors.  Let&#8217;s take a look at the geometry of the problem &#8212; again, there are two ways we could plot \(\phi\).  The usual approach is to draw a height function over the plane:</p>

<p>The derivative has something to do with the slope of this hill, but in which direction?  To answer this question, we can introduce the idea of a <em>directional derivative</em> &#8212; i.e., we pick a vector \(X\) and see how quickly we travel uphill (or downhill) in that direction.  And again we can consider an alternative picture:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_phi_plane.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_phi_plane.svg" alt="" title="ddg_phi_plane" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-143" /></a></p>
<p>Since \(\phi\) is a map from \(\mathbb{R}^2\) to \(\mathbb{R}\), we can imagine that it takes a flat sheet of rubber and stretches it out into a long, skinny, one-dimensional object along the real line.  Therefore if we draw an arrow \(X\) on the original sheet, then the &#8220;stretched-out&#8221; arrow \(d\phi(X)\) gives us the rate of change in \(\phi\) along the direction \(X\), i.e., the directional derivative.  What about type checking?  As before, everything matches up: \(d\phi(X)\) is a tangent vector on \(\mathbb{R}\), so it can be represented by a single real number.  (What if we had continued to work with the height function above?  How could we recover the directional derivative in this case?)</p>
<p>By the way, don&#8217;t worry if this discussion seems horribly informal!  We&#8217;ll see a more explicit, algebraic treatment of these ideas when we start talking about exterior calculus.  The important thing for now is to build some geometric intuition about derivatives.  In particular: a map from any space to any other space can be viewed as some kind of bending and twisting and stretching (or possibly tearing!); derivatives can be understood in terms of what happens to little arrows along the way.</p>

                <div class="entry">
                	<p>There are many ways to think about the geometry of a surface (using <em>charts</em>, for instance) but here&#8217;s a picture that is well-suited to the way we work with surfaces in the discrete setting.  Imagine that our surface is a topological disk.  Its geometry can be described via a map \(f: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3\) from a region \(M\) in the Euclidean plane \(\mathbb{R}^2\) to a subset \(f(M)\) of \(\mathbb{R}^3\):</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_surface_patch.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_surface_patch.svg" alt="" title="ddg_surface_patch" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106" /></a></p>
<p>The <em>differential</em> of such a map, denoted by \(df\), tells us how to map a vector \(X\) in the plane to the corresponding vector \(df(X)\) on the surface.  Loosely speaking, imagine that \(M\) is a rubber sheet and \(X\) is a little black line segment drawn on \(M\).  As we stretch and deform \(M\) into \(f(M)\), the segment \(X\) also gets stretched and deformed into a different segment, which we call \(df(X)\).  Later on we can talk about how to explicitly express \(df(X)\) in coordinates and so on, but it&#8217;s important to realize that fundamentally there&#8217;s <em>nothing deeper to know about the differential than the picture you see here</em> &#8212; the differential simply tells you how to stretch out or <em>&#8220;push forward&#8221;</em> vectors as you go from one space to another.  For example, the length of a tangent vector \(X\) pushed forward by \(f\) can be expressed as</p>
<p>\[ \sqrt{ df(X) \cdot df(X) }, \]</p>
<p>where \(\cdot\) is the standard inner product (a.k.a. <em>dot product</em> or <em>scalar product</em>) on \(\mathbb{R}^3\).  Note that this length is typically <em>different</em> than the length of the vector we started with!  To keep things clear, we&#8217;ll use angle brackets to denote the inner product in the plane, e.g., the length of the original vector would be \(\sqrt{\langle X, X \rangle}\).  More generally, we can measure the inner product between any <em>two</em> tangent vectors \(df(X)\) and \(df(Y)\):</p>
<p>\[ g(X,Y) = df(X) \cdot df(Y). \]</p>
<p>The map \(g\) is called the <em>metric</em> of the surface, or to be more pedantic, the <em>metric induced by \(f\)</em>.</p>
<p>So far we&#8217;ve been talking about <em>tangent</em> vectors, i.e., vectors that travel &#8220;along&#8221; the surface.  We&#8217;re also interested in vectors that are orthogonal to the surface.  In particular, we say that a vector \(u \in \mathbb{R}^3\) is <em>normal</em> to the surface at a point \(p\) if</p>
<p>\[ df(X) \cdot u = 0 \]</p>
<p>for all tangent vectors \(X\) at \(p\).  For convenience, we often single out a particular normal vector \(\hat{N}\) called the <em>unit normal</em>, which has length one.  Of course, at any given point there are two distinct unit normal vectors: \(+\hat{N}\) and \(-\hat{N}\).  Which one should we use?  If we can pick a consistent direction for \(\hat{N}\) then we say that \(M\) is <em>orientable</em>.  For instance, the torus is orientable, but the M&ouml;bius band is not:</p>
<p><center><br />
<img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_torus.svg"/><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_mobius.svg"/><br />
</center></p>
<p>For orientable surfaces, we can actually think of \(\hat{N}\) as a continuous map \(\hat{N}: M \rightarrow S^2\) (called the <em>Gauss map</em>) which associates each point with its unit normal, viewed as a point on the unit sphere \(S^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3\).  In fact, why not think of \(\hat{N}\) as simply a different geometry for \(M\)?  Now the map \(d\hat{N}\) (called the <em>Weingarten map</em>) tells us about the change in <em>normal direction</em> as we move from one point to the other.  For instance, we could look at the change in normal along a particular tangent direction \(X\) by evaluating</p>
<p>\[ \kappa_n(X) = \frac{df(X) \cdot d\hat{N}(X)}{|df(X)|^2}. \]</p>
<p>(The factor \(|df(X)|^2\) in the denominator simply accounts for any &#8220;stretching out&#8221; of \(X\) that occurs as we go from the plane to the surface.)  The quantity \(\kappa_n\) is called the <em>normal curvature</em> &#8212; we&#8217;ll have a lot more to say about curvature in the future.</p>
<p>Overall we end up with this picture, which captures the most fundamental ideas about the geometry of surfaces:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_surface_geometry.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_surface_geometry.svg" alt="" title="ddg_surface_geometry" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-108" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Conformal Parameterization</u></b></p>
<p>When working with curves, one often introduces the idea of an <em>isometric</em> (a.k.a. <em>arc-length</em> or <em>unit speed</em>) parameterization.  The idea there is to make certain expressions simpler by assuming that no &#8220;stretching&#8221; occurs as we go from the domain into \(\mathbb{R}^3\).  One way to state this requirement is</p>
<p>\[ |df(X)| = |X|, \]</p>
<p>i.e., we ask that the norm of any vector \(X\) is preserved.</p>
<p>For surfaces, an isometric parameterization does not always exist (not even locally!).  Most of the time you simply have to stretch things out.  For instance, you may know that it&#8217;s impossible to flatten the surface of the Earth onto the plane without distortion &#8212; that&#8217;s why we end up with all sorts of different funky projections of the globe.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_globe_projections.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_globe_projections.svg" alt="" title="ddg_globe_projections" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-109" /></a></p>
<p>However, there is a setup that (like arc-length parameterization for curves) makes life a lot easier when dealing with certain expressions, namely <em>conformal parameterization</em>.  Put quite simply, a map \(f\) is conformal if it preserves the <em>angle</em> between any two vectors.  More specifically, a conformal map \(f: \mathbb{R}^2 \supset M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3\) satisfies</p>
<p>\[ df(X) \cdot df(Y) = a \langle X, Y \rangle \]</p>
<p>for all tangent vectors \(X, Y\), where \(a\) is a <b>positive</b> function and \(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle\) is the usual inner product on \(\mathbb{R}^2\).  In practice, the function \(a\) is often replaced with \(e^u\) for some real-valued function \(u\) &#8212; this way, one never has to worry about whether the scaling is positive.  Notice that vectors can still get <em>stretched out</em>, but the surface never gets <em>sheared</em> &#8212; for instance, orthogonal vectors always stay orthogonal:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_conformal_map.svg"><img src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ddg_conformal_map.svg" alt="" title="ddg_conformal_map" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-110" /></a></p>
<p>A key fact about conformal maps is that they always exist, as guaranteed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformization_theorem">uniformization theorem</a>.  In a nutshell, the uniformization theorem says that any disk can be conformally mapped to the plane.  So if we consider any point \(p\) on our surface \(f(M)\), we know that we can always find a conformal parameterization in some small, disk-like neighborhood around \(p\).  As with unit-speed curves, it is often enough to simply know that a conformal parameterization <em>exists</em> &#8212; we do not have to construct the map explicitly.  And, as with arc-length parameterization, we have to keep track of the least possible amount of information about how the domain gets stretched out: just a single number at each point (as opposed to, say, an entire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant">Jacobian matrix</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From time to time in this class we may adopt the convention that \(f\) is conformal in order to simplify our derivations, so <em>pay attention!</em></p>
