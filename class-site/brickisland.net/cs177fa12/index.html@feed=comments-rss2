		<description>You make a great point, Kevin.  The function \(&#124;\varphi&#124;\) isn&#039;t differentiable at zero, so it&#039;s no surprise that the gradient of the signed angle is ill-defined when \(u\) and \(v\) are parallel!

If, as you suggest, you use the signed angle then things behave better -- in this case, the gradient is something like
\[ \nabla_u \varphi = \frac{u^\perp}{&#124;u^\perp&#124;^2} \]
where \(u^\perp\) means \(u\) rotated a quarter-turn in the counter-clockwise direction.

For the assignment, you can get things to work by simply checking whether \(A\) is close to zero.  But I&#039;ll be sure to incorporate this observation into future versions of the assignment.</description>

		<description>I&#039;m having some difficulty with the gradient expression in exercise 4.12 (which then gets used in exercise 4.14 and the coding exercise). Isn&#039;t this an expression for the gradient of the unsigned angle $&#124;\varphi&#124;$ rather than the signed angle $\varphi$?</description>

		<description>It may be useful to know that there is a method &lt;tt&gt;inner( x, B, y )&lt;/tt&gt; (declared in &lt;tt&gt;DenseMatrix.h&lt;/tt&gt;) which evaluates the inner product with respect to a given matrix $B$.  Using this routine, you should be able to implement the routines &lt;tt&gt;IsometricWillmoreFlow1D::orthogonalizeConstraints()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;IsometricWillmoreFlow1D::enforceConstraints()&lt;/tt&gt; with a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; small number of lines of code -- something like eight lines for the former and three lines for the latter (depending on your indentation style!).</description>

		<description>If you are having trouble compiling under Linux (due to new features), here&#039;s a couple things:
1) Since this assignment uses GLSL shaders, if you&#039;re having issues with OpenGL shader commands, just put
#define GL_GLEXT_PROTOTYPES
where applicable
2) If there&#039;s issues with umfpack, add -lumfpack to your Makefile</description>

		<description>Homework 4 (which will serve as your final) has been assigned and is due at 5:30pm on Friday, December 14th.  As you can probably tell there is a lot to do, so get started early!

Since I suspect there will be a lot of questions this time around, I will be holding office hours &lt;b&gt;every work day until the 14th from 4-6pm&lt;/b&gt; in my office, 329 Annenberg.

Finally, the code has changed somewhat since the previous homework.  I would suggest modifying the new Makefile using whatever flags, etc., were necessary for your previous assignments.  If you have any trouble, let it be known either here on the blog (which is more helpful to your fellow students) or via email.

Good luck!</description>

		<description>Hi Keenan,
Were you intending on having any OH for this set today or tomorrow? I have a couple of questions, but if not, I could probably just ask them here.</description>
